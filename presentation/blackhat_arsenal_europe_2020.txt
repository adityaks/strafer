Elasticsearch infections are rising exponentially. The adversaries are exploiting open and exposed Elasticsearch interfaces 
to trigger infections in the cloud and non-cloud deployments. During this talk, we will release a tool named "STRAFER" to detect 
potential infections in the Elasticsearch instances. The tool allows security researchers, penetration testers, and threat 
intelligence experts to detect compromised and infected Elasticsearch instances running malicious code. The tool also enables 
you to conduct efficient research in the field of malware targeting cloud databases.



In this version of the tool, the following modules are supported:

Elasticsearch instance information gathering and reconnaissance
Elasticsearch instance exposure on the Internet
Detecting potential ransomware infections in the Elasticsearch instances
Detecting potential botnet infections such as meow botnet
Detecting infected indices in the Elasticsearch instances
Note: This is the first release of the tool and we expect to add more modules in the nearby future
